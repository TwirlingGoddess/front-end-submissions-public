[happy code](https://github.com/TwirlingGoddess/Palette-Picker/blob/master/public/scripts.js)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I'm VERY PROUD of my vanilla cleanliness and readibility. 
The code was great, and tells a cute little story
#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/TwirlingGoddess/Palette-Picker/blob/master/knexfile.js)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
I kept chopping it up, and throwing more shit at the wall, so to me, it looks a mess, and I'm not quite sure what/why it's doing what its doing.  It's a fail to me.  I should've asked more questions sooner.
